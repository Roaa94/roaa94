			<h4>FlutterCon Berlin 2024 - Code Meets Art: Flutter for Creative Coding</h4>
			<p>In this talk, I want to show you how you can blur the lines between code and art using Flutter!</p>
			<p>
After a quick introduction into what creative coding is and how its visual feedback nature can be a great way to learn how to code, we’ll dive into the technical details on how Flutter can be used for that purpose. Starting from the custom painter and canvas API, and making our way into shaders and 3rd party tools and packages. Additionally, we will explore what it means to use algorithms to create Art and what happens when you bleed that art into user interfaces and experiences. Finally, with its cross platform capabilities and easy control over every pixel, we’ll answer the question of why use Flutter for this purpose in the first place.

			<h4>Flutter Firebase Festival 2023 - Real-time Animated Generative Art with Flutter & Firebase</h4>
			<p>We can all agree that our lives deserve more beauty in them, and what better place to introduce that beauty than the small screen we spend most of our time staring at? Generative art, animations, and interactivity are great ways to do that! With Flutter, you have access to a variety of APIs that enable you to create stunning animated visual experiences, giving user interfaces the chance to be more and more captivating. Join me in this talk as we sneak into the framework’s painting layer and see what the CustomPainter and Canvas API can do, and as we add Firebase’s real-time capabilities into the mix and come out with a fun experience for you, the audience, and your users.</p>

			<h4>Flutter & Friends 2023 - Workshop: Flutter Animations - From Beginner to Advanced</h4>
			<p>User interfaces without animations are like food without salt, just tasteless. In this workshop, you will learn how to add animations with various complexity to your Flutter UIs. We will start by covering the most basic and subtle animations created with built-in widgets, and make our way up to complex animated user interactions with advanced and customized widgets. Along the way, you will learn best practices, performance optimization, and tips on how to make your development experience and flow smoother. Lastly, just like too much salt can ruin a meal, you don’t want to overcrowd or overcomplicate your UI with too much animations, so we will end up our workshop with some important user experience tips to make sure your app has the most optimal impact on your users.</p>

			<h4>Flutter Heroes 2023 - Accelerate UI Development and Simplify Collaboration Among Designers and Developers with Widgetbook</h4>
			<p>Building UI components with Flutter is a very smooth process, and with Widgetbook, you can enhance this process further by building your UI components in a dedicated interactive platform in isolation of the app you’re building, making it easy for you to develop your widgets and screens without worrying about the business logic, and test them on different devices, themes, and locales. All of that and more is offered in an open-source package built with Flutter for Flutter developers. Additionally, with the Widgetbook Cloud solution and its various features, you can drastically improve your team’s development process and designer-developer collaboration. And in this talk I want to show you how you and your team can use Widgetbook.</p>

        <p>Recently, I gave a talk at FlutterCon Berlin 2023 about creating animations in Flutter with low level APIs, as I was preparing the talk, the content progressed to be a lot about art, more specifically, generative art and its technological history.</p>
				<p>So inspired by Vera Molnar’s artistic style and ideas, we will go over some basic principles of generative art by exploring Flutter’s CustomPainter and the Canvas API and we will introduce animations to make our artwork come to life.</p>
